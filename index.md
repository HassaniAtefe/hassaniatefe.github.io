ðŸŽ“ Recent Biomedical Engineering Master's Graduate at Shahed University, Tehran, Iran.

ðŸŽ“ Advised by <a href="[https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=EDmSL6cAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)">Prof. Ali Motie Nasrabadi</a>

My research is concentrated on biomedical signal/image analysis with more emphasis on the brain ðŸ§ . From the theoretical point of view, I am passionate about the interdisciplinary field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and healthcare, aiming to improve the entire medical imaging workflow, especially the brain with a significant impact on clinical use.

I was a visiting researcher in the Bio-Imaging lab at Antwerp University, from 2021 to 2022, where my research was focused on signal processing using electrophysiological recordings in the hippocampus with and without stimulation of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum in rats with the aim of providing valuable information for the development of new therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

ðŸ’¡Always seeking opportunities to gain valuable experience and make a meaningful impact in the field of AI in healthcare.

ðŸŒŸ Let's collaborate and drive innovation in healthcare together! ðŸŒŸ
