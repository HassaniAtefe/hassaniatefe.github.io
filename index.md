I am a guest researcher at the <a href="https://basira-lab.com/" target="_blank">BASIRA Lab</a>, Imperial College London, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=tb6CVoAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Prof. Islem Rekik</a>. Additionally, I am a part-time research intern at the <a href="https://mmilabuk.github.io/mmi-lab-website/index.html" target="_blank">Multimodal Intelligence Lab</a>, University of Exeter, where I am supervised by <a href="" target="_blank">Prof. Zeyu Fu</a>. Before that, I graduated with a masterâ€™s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Shahed University, Iran, under the supervision ofÂ <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=EDmSL6cAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Prof. Ali Motie Nasrabadi</a>, where I ranked 1st among graduate students and was selected as an outstanding researcher.

I am deeply fascinated by Multi-modal LLMs and their applications in medical imaging. Building on my previous work in multi-task federated learning, my recent research focuses on retrieval-based methods, aiming to advance the factuality, adaptability, and trustworthiness of next-generation vision-language models. By integrating these approaches, I strive to enhance AI systemsâ€™ ability to process diverse and complex multi-modal data more efficiently and robustly, ultimately improving their real-world applicability.



<!-- My research focuses on the theory and practical applications of AI and Machine Learning, especially in Medical Imaging and Federated Learning. I am working as a research intern supervised by Dr. Islem Rekik in the <a href="https://basira-lab.com/" target="_blank">BASIRA Lab</a> at Imperial College London. At the BASIRA Lab, my research focuses on multi-task federated learning with highly heterogeneous medical image classification tasks.

Prior to that, I graduated with a masterâ€™s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Shahed University, Iran, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=EDmSL6cAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Prof. Ali Motie Nasrabadi</a>, where I ranked 1st among graduate students and was selected as an outstanding researcher. My MSc project focused on developing methods to analyse user choice behavior using electroencephalography signals in neuromarketing. -->
