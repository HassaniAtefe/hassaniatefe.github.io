ðŸŽ“ Research Intern at Imperial College London, London, UK.

ðŸŽ“ Advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=tb6CVoAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Dr. Islem Rekik</a>

My research focuses on the theory and practical applications of AI and Machine Learning, especially in Medical Imaging and Federated Learning. I am working as a research intern supervised by Dr. Islem Rekik in the <a href="https://basira-lab.com/" target="_blank">BASIRA Lab</a> at Imperial College London. At the BASIRA Lab, my research focuses on multi-task federated learning with highly heterogeneous medical image classification tasks.

Prior to that, I graduated with a masterâ€™s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Shahed University, Iran, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=EDmSL6cAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Prof. Ali Motie Nasrabadi</a>, where I ranked 1st among graduate students and was selected as an outstanding researcher. My MSc project focused on developing methods to analyse user choice behavior using electroencephalography signals in neuromarketing.

<!--Prior to that, I was a visiting researcher in the Bio-Imaging lab at Antwerp University, from 2021 to 2022, where my research was focused on signal processing using electrophysiological recordings in the hippocampus with and without stimulation of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum in rats with the aim of providing valuable information for the development of new therapeutic strategies in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). -->

ðŸ’¡Always seeking opportunities to gain valuable experience and make a meaningful impact in the field of AI in healthcare.
